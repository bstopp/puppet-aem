## Module Description

[Adobe Experience Manager][] (also known as AEM, formerly CQ5) is an enterprise content management system offered by [Adobe][]. This puppet module provides a set of tools to ease the tasks of installing, configuring and maintaining AEM instances.

## Setup

**What the AEM Puppet module affects**

- AEM Installation files and directories
- Service configuration and startup files
- Listened-to ports

**Note**: This module modifies AEM installation directories and configuration files, overwriting any existing configurations. AEM configurations should be managed by Puppet, as unmanaged configuration files may cause unexpected behaviour.

### Setup Requirements 

AEM uses Ruby-based providers, so you must enable pluginsync. Java is also required to be installed on the system. Finally, due to the AEM platform being proprietary, this module does not provide the installation jar file; it must be provided by the consumer.

### Beginning with AEM

A minimal AEM configuration is specified as:

~~~
aem::instance { 'aem' :
  source => '/path/to/aem-quickstart.jar',
}
~~~

For more options and detailed explanations, please see the [Puppet AEM Wiki][wiki]

### Public Defines

#### Define: `aem::instance`

Installs an AEM instance into your system.

When this type is declared with the default options, Puppet:

- Unpacks the specified AEM jar file.
- Configures the AEM start scripts with the default configuration options.
- Starts AEM for the first time to ensure repository creation.
- Shuts AEM down to create a consistent state.
- Defines and starts an AEM Service for the instance.

See [Beginning with AEM][] for the minimum configuration required to create an AEM installation. It is suggested that you customize the AEM definion with the following parameters, as the default parameters are not recommended for production.

**Parameters within `aem::instance`:**

##### `name`
Namevar. Required. Specifies the name of the AEM instance.

##### `ensure`
Optional. Changes the state of the AEM instance. Valid values are `present` or `absent`. Default: `present`.

##### `context_root`
Optional. Specifies the URL context root for the AEM application. [Sling documentation][Sling launchpad]. Defaults to `/`.

##### `debug_port`
Optional. Specifies the port on which to listen for remote debugging connections. Setting this will add the following JVM options: `-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=<<port>>` Valid options: any port number.

##### `group`
Optional. Sets the group for installation. Valid options: any valid group. Default: `aem`.

##### `home`
Optional. Sets the directory in which AEM will be installed. Valid options: Any absolute system path. Default: `/opt/aem`.

##### `jvm_mem_opts`
Optional. Specifies options for the JVM memory. This is separated from the JVM opts to simplify configurations. Valid options: any valid JVM parameter string. Default: `-Xmx1024m`.

##### `jvm_opts`
Optional. Specifies options to pass to the JVM. Valid options: any valid JVM parameter string. Default: None. The following string is always passed, and cannot be overwritten: `-server -Djava.awt.headless=true`

##### `manage_group`
Optional. Sets whether or not this instance will manage the defined group. Valid options: `true` or `false`. Default: `true`.

##### `manage_home`
Optional. Sets whether or not this instance will manage the defined home directory. Valid options: `true` or `false`. Default: `true`.

##### `manage_user`
Optional. Sets whether or not this instance will manage the defined user. Valid options: `true` or `false`. Default: `true`.

##### `port`
Optional. Specifies the port on which AEM will listen. Valid options: any valid port. Default: 4502. [Sling documentation][Sling command-line-options]

##### `runmodes`
Optional. Sets the array of runmodes to apply to the AEM instance. Do not use this to set options available via `type` configuration, or a `sample_content` state. Valid options: any string array. [AEM documentation][AEM Runmodes].

##### `sample_content`
Optional. Sets whether or not to include the sample content (e.g. Geometrixx). Valid options: `true` or `false`. Default: `true`. [AEM Documentation][AEM Sample Content].

##### `snooze`
Optional. Sets the wait period between checks for installation completion. When monitoring the system for up state, this is the wait period between checks. Value is specified in seconds. Valid options: any number. Default: `10`.

##### `source`
Required. Sets the source jar file to use, provided by user. Valid options: any absolute path to file.

##### `status`
Optional. Changes the state of the service on the system, defining whether or not the service starts at system boot and/or is currently running. Valid values are:
* `enabled`: Start at boot & currently running (**Default**)
* `disabled`: Not started at boot & not currently running.
* `running`: Not started at boot but is currently running.
* `unmanaged`: Don't manage it with service manager, running state is arbitrary.

##### `timeout`
Optional. Sets the timeout allowed for startup monitoring. If the installation doesn't finish by the timeout, an error will be generated. Value is specified in seconds. Valid option: any number. Default: `600` (10 minutes).

##### `type`
Optional. Specifies the AEM installation type. Valid options: `author` or `publish`. Default: `author`. [AEM documentation][AEM Installation Runmodes]

##### `user`
Optional. Sets the user for installation. Valid options: any valid user. Default: `aem`.

##### `version`
Optional. Sets the version of AEM. Informational only, does not affect installation or resource management. Valid options: any semantic version. 

#### Define: `aem::license`

Manages an AEM License file. Provides a convenient tool for managing the license file contents without needing ot know the structure.

** Parameters within `aem::license`:**

##### `name`
Namevar. Required. Specifies the name of the AEM license.

##### `ensure`
Optional. Changes the state of the AEM license. Valid values are `present` or `absent`. Default: `present`.

## Limitations

### OS Compatibility

This module has been tested on: 

- CentOS 7, 7.2
- Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04
- Debian 7.8*, 8.2

*See [Known Issues][]*

### AEM Compatibility

This module has been tested with the following AEM versions:

- 6.0
- 6.1

### Warnings

It is up to the consumer to ensure that the correct version of Java is installed based on the AEM version. See [AEM Documentation][AEM Java Requirements] for compatibility.

Defining an AEM resource as absent will remove the instance from the system, regardless of whether or not it was originally managed by puppet.

### Known Issues

There is an oddity with the `aem::service` support on Debian: even though specifying a valid status sends the correct parameters to the underlying service resource, the service is not enabled, nor do state changes occur correctly. Acceptance tests on those Virtual Machines fail for issues with service management. See [issue #36](https://github.com/bstopp/puppet-aem/issues/36).

## Development

This module in its early stages, any updates or feature additions are welcome. 

_Please make sure you do not include any AEM Installer jars in PRs._
